    "One very popular tool for NLP is [spaCy](https://spacy.io). SpaCy offers many out-of-the-box tools for processing and analyzing text, and the spaCy framework allows users to extend the models for their own purposes. SpaCy consists mostly of **statistical NLP** models. In statistical models, a large corpus of text is processed and mathematical methods are used to identify patterns in the corpus. This process is called **training**. Once a model has been trained, we can use it to analyze new text. But as we'll see, we can also use spaCy to implement sophisticated rules and custom logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "SpaCy comes with several pre-trained models, meaning that we can quickly load a model which has been trained on large amounts of data. This way, we can take advantage of work which has already been done by spaCy developers and focus on our own NLP tasks. Additionally, members of the open-source spaCy community can train and publish their own models.\n",

    "- Since spaCy's built-in statistical models don't accomplish the tasks we need in clinical NLP, we'll use spaCy's pattern matchers to write rules to extract clinical concepts\n",
    "- We will then download and use a statistical model to extract clinical concepts from text\n",
    "- Some of these limitations can be addressed by writing our own rules for concept extraction, and we'll practice that with some clinical texts. We'll then go a little deeper into how spaCy's models are implemented and how we can modify them. Finally, we'll end the day by spaCy models which were designed specifically for use in the biomedical domain.\n",
